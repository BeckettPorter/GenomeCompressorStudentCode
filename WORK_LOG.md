| November 12th | 5:10 - 6:00pm | I spent a while messing with windows to get the javac command to work, which thankfully it did after I modified some system variables or something. I also had to change the terminal IntelliJ uses to use Git Bash instead of Powershell because powershell was having an issue with the < symbol. This was a pain but I finally got it to work. Then, I started working on my code and I used the same mapping technique fromm DNA. My issue is currently I'm still getting the last 3 0s at the end of the sequence and it thinks that they are 'A's, this is due to the padding I think. I need to find a way to deal with this, I haven't been able to figure it out yet though. |

Got it to work finally. |
